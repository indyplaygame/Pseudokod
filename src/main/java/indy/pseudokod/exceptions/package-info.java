/**
 * The {@link indy.pseudokod.exceptions} package contains the definitions
 * and handling mechanisms for exceptions that may occur during the execution,
 * parsing or tokenization of Pseudokod programs.
 *
 * <p>Exceptions in an interpreted language like Pseudokod play a critical
 * role in ensuring robust error reporting and proper handling of issues
 * encountered at runtime or during interpretation. This package provides
 * a central location for exceptions specific to the language and runtime
 * environment.</p>
 *
 * <p>Main Responsibilities:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Defining custom exception types for parsing, runtime errors, and semantic issues.</li>
 *   <li>Providing meaningful error messages for debugging and development.</li>
 *   <li>Supporting structured exception handling during interpretation.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For more details about the specific exception classes and their use, refer to
 * the documentation for individual classes in this package.</p>
