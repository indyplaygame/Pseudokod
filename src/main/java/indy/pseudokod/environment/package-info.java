/**
 * The {@link indy.pseudokod.environment} package provides the infrastructure
 * for managing the runtime environment and execution context of the Pseudokod.
 *
 * <p>The runtime environment plays a critical role in facilitating the execution
 * of interpreted code by maintaining the following components:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Variable bindings and their respective values during execution.</li>
 *   <li>The symbol table, which keeps track of declared identifiers for validation.</li>
 *   <li>Execution context, including scoping rules and stack frames for nested execution.</li>
 *   <li>Support for dynamic evaluation and runtime state modifications.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Main Responsibilities:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Creating and managing the global and local runtime state for the program.</li>
 *   <li>Providing a mechanism for resolving variable names and functions dynamically at runtime.</li>
 *   <li>Handling errors and exceptions raised during program execution.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Key Features:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Global and local variable scope resolution.</li>
 *   <li>Runtime support for type checking.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Usage Example:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Example: Setting up the runtime environment
 * Environment environment = new Environment();
 * environment.declareVariable("x", ValueType.Number, true, 42);
 * RuntimeValue value = environment.getVariable("x");
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>For more details on implementing and extending the runtime environment, refer
 * to the individual classes in this package.</p>
