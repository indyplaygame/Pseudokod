/**
 * The {@link indy.pseudokod.parser} package provides the classes necessary
 * for parsing Pseudokod programs into an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation.
 *
 * <p>The parser is a critical part of the Pseudokod interpreter, responsible for analyzing
 * the sequence of tokens produced by the lexer and constructing a structured tree representation
 * that reflects the syntactic structure of the source code. This tree, known as the AST,
 * serves as the foundation for program analysis, interpretation, and execution.</p>
 *
 * <p>Main Responsibilities:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Parsing the input tokens to validate the syntax of a Pseudokod program.</li>
 *   <li>Building an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the program's structure.</li>
 *   <li>Providing error feedback on invalid or unexpected syntax.</li>
 *   <li>Handling complex language constructs, such as expressions, statements,
 *       control flow, and function definitions.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Key Components:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Parser Engine:</strong> Responsible for implementing the grammar rules
 *       of the Pseudokod language and converting token sequences into an AST.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Nodes:</strong> Represents program elements, such as
 *       expressions, variable declarations, loops, and conditionals.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Provides detailed information about syntax errors.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Example Usage:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Example: Parsing a Pseudokod program
 * Parser parser = new Parser();
 * Program program = parser.produceAST(source);
 *
 * // Evaluate the parsed program
 * Interpreter.evaluate(program);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>By converting tokenized input into a structured AST, this package enables further processing
 * stages, such as semantic analysis, optimization, and program execution, within the Pseudokod
 * interpreter pipeline.</p>
 *
 * <p>For more details, refer to the individual class documentation in this package.</p>
